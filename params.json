So you can insert any `console` method as you want.\r\n\r\n##Usage \r\n```Note: the first arguments need to be a meaningful string```\r\n\r\nYou can just simply call Logger as\r\n\r\n    Logger('foo', 'bar')\r\n    \r\nOr, call the original function such like console.info... \r\n\r\n    Logger.info('foo', 'bar')\r\n    Logger.warn('bar', 'bar')\r\n    Logger.log('foo', {'foo':'bar'})\r\n    \r\n##If you are using require.js...\r\n    \r\ncheck out ```require.logger.coffee``` or ```require.logger.js```\r\n\r\n##Cheers!","tagline":"console.log for production and development  invironment"}
